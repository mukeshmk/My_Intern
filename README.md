The Project is to create a Data Base, which only an authentic person can login. And the Data Base is to contain a Table similar to that of an excel sheet present in the assets folder.

Goal is to make working DBMS where one can insert,delete and search for data in the table

If you want to try it out, here's what you would need to do.

1. Download "wampserver" from http://www.wampserver.com/en/

2. Install it and start the server.

3. Now get this repo here:-

    i. Go to the location where "wampserver is installed"
       Usually its in ur C Drive it self, named as "wamp"
       In that case clone it here:
       
       C:\wamp\www
      
    ii.Go to the location where "wampserver is installed"
       And clone it here:-
       
       ...\wamp\www

4. Now open your browser and in the link bar type:-
   localhost/My_Intern/
   (make sure you have started the server)

5. Now try it out.

6. Do report if any bugs or improvements is to be made. 

Thank You
